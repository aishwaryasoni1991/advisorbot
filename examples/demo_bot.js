This is a sample Slack bot built with Botkit.

This bot demonstrates many of the core features of Botkit:

* Connect to Slack using the real time API
* Receive messages based on "spoken" patterns
* Send a message with attachments
* Send a message via direct message (instead of in a public channel)

# RUN THE BOT:

  Get a Bot token from Slack:

    -> http://my.slack.com/services/new/bot

  Run your bot from the command line:

    token=<MY TOKEN> node demo_bot.js

# USE THE BOT:

  Find your bot inside Slack to send it a direct message.

  Say: "Hello"

  The bot will reply "Hello!"

  Say: "Attach"

  The bot will send a message with a multi-field attachment.

  Send: "dm me"

  The bot will reply with a direct message.

  Make sure to invite your bot into other channels using /invite @<my bot>!

# EXTEND THE BOT:

  Botkit has many features for building cool and useful bots!
